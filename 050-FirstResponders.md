# 050-FirstResponders

## First responder considerations

* First responder: The first person at the scene of a suspected computer crime
* Duty: To `preserve` as much evidence as possible for subsequent examination
* Need to recognise the relevant evidence may be found on all sorts of devices and even hard copy

## Collection and preservation of the evidence

* Field kit for collecting evidence:
  * Camera
  * Screwdriver with assorted small bits
  * Regular and needle-nosed pilers
  * Wire cutters
  * Tamper-resistant tape
  * Flashlight
  * Pen with indelible ink
  * Hard drive storage cases
  * Evidence tags
  * Gloves
  * Bags
  * Boxes
  * Labels
  * Rubber bands
  * Notebook / pen

# Identifying evidence

## Photographs taking

* Photographically document the entire crime scene showing the location of every digital evidence
* Examples:
  * Computer’s active screen
  * Passwords
  * Books
  * Back of computers

## Documentation of crime scene

* Creates a `permanent historical record` of the scene
* Should record:
  * `Who` — Took photos, secured the digital crime scene and what methods they used, marked the computers, prepared the sketch, seized the computers, and took exit photos
  * `Time` — The time when entered the scene, took control and left

## More on documentation of crime scene

* The document should also include:
* The `type, location, condition, and power status` of the device(s)
* A record of all `activities and processes` visible on the display screen(s)
* A record of all `physical connections` to and from the computer to another devices
* A record of any `network` and wireless `components` capable of linking devices to each others and the Internet
* The type, condition and power status of the device’s Internet and `network access`

## Sketch the scene

* Record where the potential digital evidence was `located`
* An `overhead` view is the most common form of crime scene sketching
* Assist in `recreating`/conveying the details of the crime scene
* Doing the best possible documentation with the resources available, not 100% accurate

## Computers in a complex environment...

* Computers may connect to each other, connect to servers, or both
* Improper shut down may destroy data
* Need to recognise the power status of the computer systems
* Need to recognise the status of the connectivity of the computer systems

## If the computer is off...

* Do not turn it on!
  * Turn on the computer and take a quick peek at the files can change the data
* If the computer is off, leave it off

## If the computer is on...

* The data that is contained in the memory chips is lost when the computer is shut down
* The computer may activate destructive programs at shutdown
* `Live forensic` investigation may be needed

## Hard shut down

* By pulling the power cord from the electrical device and/or removing the battery
  * Pros:
    - Preserve some system files
    - Prevent destructive program activation on shutdown
    - Prevent changes to time stamp
    - Prevent changes to file attributes
  * Cons:
    - Lose unsaved open files
    - Corrupt operating system and open documents

## Graceful shutdown

* Close the system in the recommended manner
  * Pros:
    - Identify and close open files
    - Ensure a more successful boot of the computer
  * Cons:
    - Lose some system files
    - Activate destructive programs at shutdown

## Live forensics

* Live-box analysis
* Capture and preserve the physical memory or volatile data before turning off the computer

## Order of volatility

* Collecting evidence should proceed from the most volatile to the less volatile
* Example of order of volatility of a typical computer system:
  * Registers, cache
  * Routing table, process table, kernel statistics
  * Memory
  * Temporary file systems / Swap space
  * Disk
  * Remote logged data
  * Physical configuration and network topology
  * Archival media (e.g., CD-ROMs, floppies, etc)
  * Printout

## Packaging a computer

* Tamper-resistant evidence tape over the power port and edge of computer case
* Document the person-in-charge, date, serial number
* Inside paper bag or anti-static bag with seal

## Evidence bag

* Label:
  * Evidence #
  * Case #
  * Date / Time
  * Location
  * Collected by
  * Description
