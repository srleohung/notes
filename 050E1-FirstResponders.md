Disagree on the action of putting the evidence in a plastic garbage bag as that is prone to static, which may cause the hard disk being damaged by static electricity.

Disagree on the action of tying the bag using a string. This would allow the evidence being tampered without traces.

He should put the hard disk in an anti-static bag and sealed it with anti-tampered evidence tape.

不同意將證據放入塑料垃圾袋的做法，因為它容易產生靜電，可能會導致硬盤被靜電損壞。

不同意用繩子系袋子的動作。 這將使證據被篡改而不留痕跡。

他應該將硬盤放入防靜電袋中，並用防篡改證據膠帶密封。

### 5. (4 marks) After Kent delivered the evidence to the laboratory, he placed the evidence under his desk in the laboratory instead of keeping them in the Evidence Inventory in accordance with procedures. He then went to dinner for an hour and the evidence remains unattended. Two hours later, he transferred the exhibits to the Evidence Inventory. Do you think this is a proper way to handle evidence? Justify your answer with consideration of the requirements of a piece of evidence to have the probative value.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
No. This is not a proper way to keep the exhibits under his desk, as this action is a break in Chain of Custody. The suspect can denied committing any offence and argued that someone might have planted the data in the computer, which were not stored properly by Kent. The evidence loss its admissibility.

<p>
不。這不是將展品放在他辦公桌下的正確方式，因為這種行為會打破監管鏈。 嫌疑人可以否認犯有任何罪行，並辯稱有人可能將數據植入了計算機中，而 Kent 沒有正確存儲這些數據。 證據喪失其可採性。
