## Characteristics of digital evidence 數字證據的特徵

* `Highly fragile` 極易碎
  + Can be easily altered, damaged or destroyed
* `Intangible, latent` 無形的, 潛在的
  + Cannot “see” what is contained in the physical object that holds the evidence
  + Specific equipment and software are required to make them “visible”
* `Hard to prove its originality and integrity` 難以證明其原創性和完整性
* `Diversity` 多樣性
* `Not easy to obtain the evidence` 取證不易, can transcend national borders with ease and speed

## Roles of digital evidence 數字證據的作用

* Digital evidence could play any or all of three roles in a crime:
  + `Target of a crime` 犯罪目標
  + `Instrument of a crime` 犯罪工具
  + `Repository of evidence that documents the crime itself` 記錄犯罪本身的證據庫

## Locard’s Exchange Principle

* Any action of an individual, and obviously the violent action constituting a crime, cannot occur without leaving a trace

* 任何個人的行為, 顯然構成犯罪的暴力行為, 都不能不留痕跡地發生

## Evidence handling principles 取證原則

* Principle 1: `No change of data` 數據無變化
* Principle 2: `Only competent persons should access digital evidence` 只有有能力的人才能訪問數字證據
* Principle 3: `Documentation` 文檔
* Principle 4: `Ownership` 所有權

## Chain of custody 監管鏈

* One of the most important aspects in computer forensics is maintaining and documenting the `chain of custody` (a.k.a. continuity of possession) of evidence
* It is the `documentation` of all steps that evidence has taken from the time it is located at a crime scene to the time it is introduced in a courtroom
* All steps include `collection, transportation, retrieval, examination and analysis, protection and storage procedures` have to be documented
* Each person who handled evidence may be required to testify that the evidence presented in court is the `same` as when it was processed during the investigation
  + i.e., Testify to what happened to the evidence while it was in their custody and how the evidence was stored and protected

* 計算機取證最重要的方面之一是維護和記錄證據的`監管鏈`（即佔有的連續性）
* 它是證據從位於犯罪現場到被引入法庭所採取的所有步驟的`文件`
* 所有步驟包括`收集、運輸、檢索、檢查和分析、保護和儲存程序`必須記錄在案
* 每個處理證據的人都可能需要作證, 證明在法庭上提交的證據與調查期間處理的證據`相同`
   * 即, 證明證據在他們保管期間發生了什麼, 以及證據是如何存儲和保護的

## Chain of Custody form

* A chain of custody form is required to record the transfer of evidence, `who, when, where, and why`
<details>

* 需要一份監管鍊錶格來記錄證據的轉移, `誰、何時、何地以及為什麼`
