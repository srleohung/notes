# 030-DigitalEvidence

## What is an evidence?
* The available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid
  * Provides direct proof of the truth of an assertion
  * Merely consistent with an assertion but does not rule out other, contradictory assertions, as in circumstantial evidence

## Evidence that want to use in a court...

* Any evidence that want to use in a court case must be
  * `Admissible` 可受理
    * Should be `relevant` to the case, act in support of the client presenting it and be well communicated and non-prejudiced
    * Must be related to the fact being proved
  * `Authentic` 真正的
    * Evidence should be relevant, that serves to prove or disprove facts in a case
    * Must be real and related to the incident in a proper way
    * The investigators must provide supporting documents regarding the authenticity of the evidence with details such as source and its relevance to the case
  * `Complete` 完全的
    * Collect evidence that can help proving the attacker’s actions
    * Collect evidence that may contradict or otherwise diminish the reliability of other potentially incriminating evidence held about the suspect
    * Collect evidence that eliminates alternative suspects
    * No tunnel vision
  * `Reliable` 可靠的
    * Evidence collection and analysis procedures must not cast doubt on the evidence’s authenticity and veracity
  * `Believable` 可信的
    * The evidence presented should be clear, easy to understand and believable by a jury

## Characteristics of digital evidence 
* `Highly fragile` 極易碎
  * Can be easily altered, damaged or destroyed
* `Intangible, latent` 無形的，潛在的
  * Cannot “see” what is contained in the physical object that holds the evidence
  * Specific equipment and software are required to make them “visible”
* `Hard to prove its originality and integrity` 難以證明其原創性和完整性
* `Diversity` 多樣性
* `Not easy to obtain the evidence` 取證不易, can transcend national borders with ease and speed

## Roles of digital evidence 數字證據的作用

* Digital evidence could play any or all of three roles in a crime:
  * `Target of a crime` 犯罪目標
  * `Instrument of a crime` 犯罪工具
  * `Repository of evidence that documents the crime itself` 記錄犯罪本身的證據庫

## Locard’s Exchange Principle

* Any action of an individual, and obviously the violent action constituting a crime, cannot occur without leaving a trace

## Evidence handling principles 取證原則

* Principle 1: `No change of data` 數據無變化
* Principle 2: `Only competent persons should access digital evidence` 只有有能力的人才能訪問數字證據
* Principle 3: `Documentation` 文檔
* Principle 4: `Ownership` 所有權

## Chain of custody 監管鏈

* One of the most important aspects in computer forensics is maintaining and documenting the `chain of custody` (a.k.a. continuity of possession) of evidence
* It is the `documentation` of all steps that evidence has taken from the time it is located at a crime scene to the time it is introduced in a courtroom
* All steps include `collection, transportation, retrieval, examination and analysis, protection and storage procedures` have to be documented
* Each person who handled evidence may be required to testify that the evidence presented in court is the `same` as when it was processed during the investigation
  * i.e., Testify to what happened to the evidence while it was in their custody and how the evidence was stored and protected

## Chain of Custody form

* A chain of custody form is required to record the transfer of evidence, `who, when, where, and why`
