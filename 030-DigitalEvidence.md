## Evidence that want to use in a court...

* Any evidence that want to use in a court case must be
  * `Admissible`
  * `Authentic`
  * `Complete`
  * `Reliable`
  * `Believable`

## Characteristics of digital evidence 
* `Highly fragile`
  * Can be easily altered, damaged or destroyed
* `Intangible, latent`
  * Cannot “see” what is contained in the physical object that holds the evidence
  * Specific equipment and software are required to make them “visible”
* `Hard to prove its originality and integrity`
* `Diversity`
* `Not easy to obtain the evidence`, can transcend national borders with ease and speed

## Roles of digital evidence

* Digital evidence could play any or all of three roles in a crime:
  * `Target of a crime`
  * `Instrument of a crime`
  * `Repository of evidence that documents the crime itself`

## Locard’s Exchange Principle

* Any action of an individual, and obviously the violent action constituting a crime, cannot occur without leaving a trace

## Evidence handling principles

* Principle 1: `No change of data`
* Principle 2: `Only competent persons should access digital evidence`
* Principle 3: `Documentation`
* Principle 4: `Ownership`

## Chain of custody

* One of the most important aspects in computer forensics is maintaining and documenting the `chain of custody` (a.k.a. continuity of possession) of evidence
* It is the `documentation` of all steps that evidence has taken from the time it is located at a crime scene to the time it is introduced in a courtroom
* All steps include `collection, transportation, retrieval, examination and analysis, protection and storage procedures` have to be documented
* Each person who handled evidence may be required to testify that the evidence presented in court is the `same` as when it was processed during the investigation
  * i.e., Testify to what happened to the evidence while it was in their custody and how the evidence was stored and protected

## Chain of Custody form

* A chain of custody form is required to record the transfer of evidence, `who, when, where, and why`
