## Types of malware

* `Computer virus`
  * A self-replicating computer program which can attach itself to other files/programs
  * Can execute secretly when the host program/file is activated
  * When the virus is executed, it can perform a number of tasks, such as erasing your files/hard disk, displaying nuisance information, attaching to other files, etc

* `Worm`
  * A self-replicating program that does not need to attach to a host program/file
  * Can execute themselves
  * Can spread over a network (e.g., through attachment in emails or instant messages file transfers) and can initiate massive and destructive attacks in a short period of time
  * Can spread though shared media (e.g., USB drives, CD, DVD data disks)

* `Trojan`
  * A non-replicating program that appears legitimate, but actually performs malicious and illicit activities when executed
  * Can steal a user’s password information, or destroy programs or data on the hard disk

* `Spyware`
  * A type of software that secretly forwards information about a user (e.g., online activities, files accessed on the computer, or even user's keystrokes) to third parties without the user’s knowledge or consent
  * Normally it is spread to machines by users who inadvertently ask for it, by downloading other programs, visiting infected sites, etc
  * Loss of confidentiality

* `Adware`
  * A type of software that displays advertising banners while a program is running
    - Spy on and gather information from a victim’s computer
    - Display an advertising banner related to the information collected
* `Botnets`
  * A zombie computer is a computer attached to the Internet that has been compromised and manipulated without the knowledge of the computer owner
  * A botnet refers to a network of zombie computers that have been taken over and put under the remote control of an attacker
    - The whole botnet can be used by the attacker for a massive attack, such as DDoS (the Distributed Denial of Service) attack, against another system or network

* `Ransomware`
  * Demand the user of the infected system pay in order to have their system’s functionality restored
  * Spreads through downloadable files or through websites
  * Once the prospective target executes the file, it will deploy its payload which either encrypts files on the user’s hard drive or may modify the boot record of the system to restrict user access

* `Rootkits`
  * A collection of files that alter the standard functionality of an operating system on a computer in a malicious and stealthy manner
  * Allows an attacker to act as system administer on the victim’s system
  * May mask the presence of the process running on a system with hooking techniques

* Backdoors

* Logic bombs

* Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
  * Use hundreds of hosts on the Internet to attack the victim
    - Each computer in the network attempt to contact the same computer or server
    - Target system becomes flooded with request and cannot handle the volume
    - Loss of services to users
  * Used by hackers to target government and business Internet sites
