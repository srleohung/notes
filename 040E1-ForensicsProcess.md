## 3. One of the forensics process is collection, in which the computer forensic specialist are required to seize the evidence from the crime scene.
### (a) Briefly discuss the information required to be shown on the evidence bag. 
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
The information that should be exhibit on an evidence bag generally includes: case number, evidence number, date, time, location, the person who collected the evidence and a brief description of the evidence collected.

Labels are placed on both ends of a cable to help document how and what were connected to the PC at the time it was collected, which allows reassemble of the computer during examination, hence reconstructing the crime scene.
</p>
</details>  

### (c) Why the computer forensic specialist must take precaution, and use standardized and accepted practice during the collection process? Try to discuss the issues based on the properties and the probative value of evidence.
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
Digital evidence are highly fragile, which can be easily altered, damaged or destroyed.
They computer forensic specialist must take precaution to ensure that the digital evidence has not been destroyed or tampered.
Moreover, to be used in the court, the evidence must be admissible, authentic, complete, reliable and believable. The computer forensic specialist must use standardized and accepted practice to ensure the integrity and authentication of the evidence.
